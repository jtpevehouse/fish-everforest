This will expose the function called `theme_everforest`.
It is a simple function that takes two arguments.
The first is the mode, either `light` or `dark`.
The second is the contrast, `soft`, `medium` or `hard`.
The defaults are `light` and `medium`.

To automatically apply this theme, call `theme_everforest` from your `config.fish`.
